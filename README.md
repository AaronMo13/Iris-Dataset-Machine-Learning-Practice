# Iris-Dataset-Machine-Learning-Practice
Here we firstly analyse the Iris dataset to ensure it is ready to be used to create models, and then we experiment with many machine learning models to attempt to classify the species of flowers. The aim here is not to try to make the best model, just to experiment with some available models.
